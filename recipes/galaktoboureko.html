            </h2>
            <p>Galaktoboureko is a traditional Greek dessert featuring a custard in a crispy phyllo pastry shell. My mom got this recipe from a coworker and made it regularly when I was young. After all these years, it's still a family favorite. I hope that everyone enjoys it as much as we do.</p>
            <p>It take 1h and 40mins for prep and 50mins for cooking time</p>
            <p>16 servings</p>

        <ul>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <li>2 ½ cups white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup semolina flour</li>
            <li>3 ½ tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>6 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¾ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>12 sheets phyllo dough</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <li>Whisk 1 cup sugar, semolina, cornstarch, and salt together in a medium bowl until no cornstarch clumps remain.</li>
            <li>Bring milk to a boil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Gradually stir in semolina mixture with a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens and comes to a full boil. Remove from the heat and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed. Add 1/2 cup sugar and beat for a full 10 minutes until thick and pale. Stir in vanilla. Fold mixture into the hot semolina mixture. Partially cover the pan and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place one phyllo sheet into the pan and brush with melted butter; repeat with six more sheets. Pour custard into the pan, then add the remaining phyllo sheets, one at a time, brushing each with butter</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top crust is crisp and custard filling has set, 40 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the custard is just about finished baking, stir remaining 1 cup sugar and water together in a small saucepan; bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Remove custard from the oven and spoon hot syrup over top, particularly around the edges. Let cool to room temperature, then cut into 16 squares and serve.</li>
